            <h4>Britain in the winter months paints beautiful scenes of frosty fields and icy lakes. But for some, this winter landscape offers more than just a picturesque view. For some, it allows them to test their physical and mental strengths as they dare to take a dip in the icy waters. </h4>
            <p>Taking a dip in a peaceful lagoon after a long sweaty hike up and down cowering mountains or along moss-covered forest paths is an experience many are not estranged to. The plunge into the refreshing cool water gives a feeling like none other, offering blissful relaxation after our bodies have been pushed to their physical limits. But as the days get colder, the swimmers get fewer. And in the midst of winter, an outdoor swim becomes a challenge in itself. It no longer offers comfort or refreshment, but instead offers something far more exhilarating, far more physically demanding, and, some say, far more rewarding.    </p>

            <p>All over the world a vast tribe of outdoor swimmers take to the water in the midst of winter. They push their bodies to the limit and take part in an extreme sport from just outside their back door. It can be one of the hardest and most dangerous sports, challenging the human body with something we by nature are not adapted to be able to endure. But with this strife, many believe comes something incredible. Sending the body into a flux of adrenaline and survival instinct, wild winter swimming is believed to be highly beneficial for both the muscles and the heart. But above all, swimming in icy cold temperatures seems to offer the swimmers an incomparable feeling of mental strength as they achieve peace with their hostile environment. While the rest of the world stay safe and content within their warm, heated homes, there are a few who step outside their comfort zones and, instead, chose to conquer the cold.   </p>

          <h2> An afternoon with the Yorkshire Outdoor Swimmers </h2>
            <p>A visit to see the Yorkshire Outdoor Swimmers both confirmed and challenged expectation. </p>
            <p>The swimmers emerged, one by one, from the depths of the icy lake and walked towards the club house, red all over, almost delirious, unable to walk by themselves. They were taken with haste to change into dry clothes and to warm up slowly and naturally. Often they were unable to talk when first out of the water, confused as to where they were or what was going on. To any outsider it looked as if they were in a concerning state of health, or at least having a fully unpleasant time. And yet as they sat there after they had recovered, clutching at their cups of teas and still shaking uncontrollably, the words they spoke contradicted how they appeared to the eye of a naive onlooker. They loved the sport, and it offered each and everyone of them something of personal value. </p>

              Rob Rooker, 52, described the experience as one of intense anxiety but also peace and calm. He said “I come, I’m anxious, nervous, and I get in and I feel calm, feel my body, feel my heart rate’s going down so I feel comfortable.” When asked what he loves most about it, he said “the effects it has on your body and on your mind.” He spoke of the personal challenge it offers, sees it as a trial of endurance which ends in immense satisfaction – “you got to try and put any negativity away, squeeze it out. Don’t ever let any negativity get in your mind, because it’s dangerous.” </p>
            <p>Naomi Crowder, the eldest member of the club at 81, said “it’s like an achievement. When I come out I feel fresh and invigorated.” Unlike most at the club who are skin swimmers, Crowder choses to wear a wetsuit. She does wild swimming all over the world and still to this age competes in long distance races. She said “I think it does you good. I think it keeps me happy. I stay active. It helps.”</p>

            <p>“You feel really good for the day, it’s quite exhilarating,” said Theo Pearson, 32, who said he does skin swimming mainly for the physical benefits. “It hurts when you first go in and then your body kind of goes tingly and it’s quite nice and then you start going almost drunk when you get really really cold but then come out, have a big shiver, and feel great for the rest of the day. And you’re really warm - once you’re warm again it lasts all day.” </p>

<h2>The health benefits
</h2>
<p>
Also a cardiac physiologist, Theo Pearson spoke of the affects swimming in such cold temperatures has on the body. He said it is important to heat the body up slowly after the swim, just as you would for a hyperthermia casualty. He said “when you get hypothermia you go cold and things shut down in an order. So your fingers go and your toes go at the same time, then slowly everything shuts down, till you’re left with your brain and your kidneys functioning.”
</p>
<p>Because of this, Pearson said you must reverse the process by heating up the core first, as opposed to the extremities, which is why a warm cup of tea and only moderate external heat is a good way to recover. He said “one of the issues is, when you go in the hot from coming out of the cold, your blood vessels relax and that causes your blood pressure to drop and that can give you dramas. But gentle heat like that will be fine.”
</p>

<p>While the benefits of it are largely unknown, Pearson said many believe that it is good for your immune system and your blood circulation, as well as your physical fitness and endurance.
</p>
<p> But above all, this form of extreme sport seemed to offer the swimmers something immensely beneficial for their mental health. They said it challenges their courage and mental strength, and releases endorphins which fill the mind with euphoria. To achieve something so challenging seems to leave these swimmers with confidence, a feeling of achievement, and a strong sense of resilience to the concept of defeat. </p>

<p> From Land’s End to John O’Groats lies numerous expanses of lakes, rivers, lagoons, and lochs. Potential dwells below secret bays and back street reservoirs. The world’s best wild outdoor swimming spots are neither exclusive to the summer months nor tropical locations. They are there and waiting. All you need is yourself, a few companions, some safety awareness, and, above all, a yearning for adventure. </p>
<p> You never know until you try. </p>
